                 <b>Plans: </b> During this profect we faced many many obstacles to include: working full-time, skill level, and time management. 
                 There are many things we sought to accompolish during the process and which we will continue on in our next level of the project. 
                 We are interested in truly understanding the value in coffee in different parts of the world and possibly look to compare it to the 
                 likes of teas and other energy type drinks. The question we want to answer is whether coffee truly is <b>The Nectar of the Gods</b>.
