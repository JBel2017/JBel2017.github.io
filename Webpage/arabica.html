            <h1> Taste</h1>
            <p>Arabica has a mild taste and based on regular coffee drinkers, they describe the coffee bean to have a light and airy sweetness. It also has some hints of chocolate, nuts, and caramel in it. However, it also has a little acidity and slight bitterness. The flavors of the coffee beans can be affected by the period or the length of time that they are roasted. Aside from that, the area and the soil where the beans are grown can also affect the coffee bean’s harmony of flavors.</p>
            <h1> Growing Preferences</h1>
            <p>The Arabica coffee beans cannot grow on harsh climates. They usually grow in temperatures between 15 degrees Celsius and 24 degrees Celsius and they like to be grown in the shade.  Arabica coffee beans can tolerate low temperatures but not frost. They are usually planted on hillsides and grounds with elevations of around 1,900 feet above sea level and they take about seven years to mature fully. The Arabica plant can grow from 9 to 12 meters in the wild, but if it’s grown commercially, it can grow up to 5 meters tall.

                    The flowers of the Arabica plant are usually small and white. And the beans, which are actually the seeds of the arabica plant, can be found inside of the berries. There are usually two arabica beans in each berry and they are harvested once they achieve a deep red color. These berries do not ripen at the same time, that is why the best way to harvest these berries are by hand-picking them. This way, you can pick the perfectly ripenedArabica bean because if you harvest them before they are fully ripe, it can result in a low-quality Arabica coffee bean.
                    
                    The arabica plant grows perfectly in tropical climates around the equator. This is why the best coffee and high-quality Arabica coffee beans can be found in Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Brazil, Columbia, Guatemala, Ecuador, Mexico, and Burundi. Among these places, Brazil is known to be the largest producer of Arabica coffee in the world.</p>
