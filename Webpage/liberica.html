             <h1>Liberica</h1>
                 <p>Coffee Liberica is the third most popular coffee bean species in the world. 
                     It originated in West and Central Africa, Liberia and Uganda.  But today, 
                     it has been naturalized in French Polynesia, Colombia, Malaysia, Venezuela, 
                     Central America, Brazil, and the Philippines. The Liberica 
                     coffee has a fruity and floral flavor and it has a woody taste. Unfortunately, 
                     the Liberica Coffee plant is currently endangered. And it is somewhat difficult to find one commercially.

            <h1> Excelsa</h1>
            <p>Excelsa Coffee used to be considered a unique species of coffee but experts recently re-classified it as a variety of Liberica Coffee. The Excelsa beans grow in large trees in medium altitudes and they are mostly found in Southeast Asia. Excelsa coffee accounts for almost seven percent of the worldâ€™s coffee production Its coffee beans also look like the beans of the Liberica plant but only smaller.

                    Excelsa coffee has a distinctive flavor that tastes like a tart or a ripened fruit. It is often mixed with Robusta and Arabica because it creates complexity and character to the coffee blend.</p>
