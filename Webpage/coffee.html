                                                It originated in West and Central Africa, Liberia and Uganda.  But today, it has been naturalized 
                                                in French Polynesia, Colombia, Malaysia, Venezuela, Central America, Brazil, and the Philippines. 
                                                The Liberica coffee has a fruity and floral flavor and it has a woody taste.
                                                <b>Excelsa</b> Coffee used to be considered a unique species of coffee but experts recently 
                                                re-classified it as a variety of Liberica Coffee. The Excelsa beans grow in large trees in 
                                                medium altitudes and they are mostly found in Southeast Asia. Excelsa coffee accounts for almost 
                                                seven percent of the world’s coffee production Its coffee beans also look like the beans of the Liberica 
                                                plant but only smaller.

                                                Excelsa coffee has a distinctive flavor that tastes like a tart or a ripened fruit. It is often mixed with 
                                                Robusta and Arabica because it creates complexity and character to the coffee blend.
