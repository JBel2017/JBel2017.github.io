             <h1>All about Robusta</h1>
                 <p>Robusta is commonly grown in the Eastern Hemisphere because it is a resilient plant that can withstand full sun and hot temperatures like 30 degrees Celsius and over. You just need a lot of water to keep the plant hydrated. The Robusta plant can grow at low altitudes like 600 meters above sea level and it is resistant to disease and insects. When the Robusta plant grows in the wild, it can raise up to ten meters tall, but when it is grown for commercial use it is trimmed to about five meters in height to make harvesting a lot easier. It blooms white flowers that have a sweet smell like jasmine. And its fruit changes its colors from green to deep red as it ripens which usually takes about six to eight months. Just like the blueberries, the Robusta coffee plantâ€™s fruit does not ripen at the same time that is why the best way to harvest the fruit is by hand-picking them one by one because there can be ripe and unripe fruit on the same branch. One ripe coffee berry usually contains two coffee beans.

                        As we mentioned earlier, the Robusta beans have a higher caffeine content. This feature makes the plant less prone to pests and disease because pests do not like the bitter flavor and the disease cannot stand its natural antimicrobial properties. A cup of brewed Robusta coffee has over twice the amount of caffeine compared to a cup of Arabica coffee.
                        
                        The Robusta plant grows perfectly in warmer climates that is why these plants are commonly grown in Vietnam, India, Brazil, Indonesia, Guatemala, Guinea, Madagascar, Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Uganda, Cameroon, and Cote Divoire.
                        
                        If you see these countries listed as a source of beans on your bag of coffee, there might be some Robusta beans in there because it is commonly added to the bags of Arabica coffee as a filler to save more money in production., tone, smooth, and nourish the skin.
